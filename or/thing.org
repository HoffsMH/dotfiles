** TODO all of this persisted into dotfiles repo
** TODO brew list persisted into dotfiles and schema to install base things
** TODO work on cloud storage
		- Another small note. To the extent that I can limit my devices cloud storage becomes better and better
			once I have a single laptop all of the sudden I only need to push documents to the phone for things like
			grocery lists. I will probably rarely if ever write notes on my phone and if I do it will only be very
			rapid and basic things that I dont want to forget

			SyncThing is too clunky as a mechanism to get things onto my phone rapidly
			DropBox "just works" so thats nice but it also has shit security
			Sync has great security but none of the common apps that I would use to look at notes has sync integration

			after having though about this some more I think it might make sense to just go with 2 cloud storage solutions
			one is my redundancy that has important data

			one is just for transporting insensitive text files around to keep myself organized
			which means when I am persisting to one of these that I need to ask myself whether or not the data is sensitive
			Assume all data on dropbox is public basically

			syncthing is SO cool but it only works device to device I basically want to
*** TODO categorize the different reasons that I need cloud storage
		be skeptical of each reason
		- rapid persistance of files on phone attached to mobile network
		- persistance of files that I want *around* but not on any particular device at all times
*** TODO categorize each item that goes into cloud storage and ask if I really need that on my machine
		- pictures taken on my phone
			- I just need it for immeadiate backup I really just need rapid persistence (in the field)
		- documents captured on my phone
