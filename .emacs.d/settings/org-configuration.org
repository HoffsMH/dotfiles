* Basic Settings
  Record the time that a todo was archived.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (setq org-log-done 'time)
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq org-ellipsis "â¤µ")
  #+END_SRC

* Archiving
  Store my org files in =~/org=, and archive finished tasks in
  =~/documents/org/archive.org=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq org-directory "~/personal/")

    (defun org-file-path (filename)
      "Return the absolute address of an org file, given its relative name."
      (concat (file-name-as-directory org-directory) filename))

    (setq org-archive-location
    (concat (org-file-path "archive/archive.org") "::* From %s"))
  #+END_SRC

  Hitting =C-c C-x C-s= will mark a todo as done and move it to an appropriate
  place in the archive.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (defun hrs/mark-done-and-archive ()
      "Mark the state of an org-mode item as DONE and archive it."
      (interactive)
      (org-todo 'done)
      (org-archive-subtree))

    (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-x C-s") 'hrs/mark-done-and-archive)
  #+END_SRC
